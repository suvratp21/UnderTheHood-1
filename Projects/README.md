# Final Projects


## Unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe Game
Written by team: [qtsimp](https://github.com/laveshg21/UnderTheHood-210562/blob/3efe375d9768d826467191cc08d2b1a1dbe52b72/Teams/qtsimp/README.md)

The final phase of the project required us to implement a **Tic Tac Toe** game in **MIPS Assembly Language**. Creation of user interface and the algorithm for finding the _best computer move_ were needed to be coded. 

The interface contains the current status of the board like:
> _ _ _ <br/>
> O X _ <br/>
> O _ _ <br/>

User always has the first turn. And the user can continue his turn by entering the desired position as input:

> 1 2 3 <br/>
> 4 5 6 <br/>
> 7 8 9 <br/>

At the end, the game tells who won.

## DATE CONVERTER
Team name - [rishi_abir_dhruv_vishant](https://github.com/HyBobu/rishi_abir_dhruv_vishant-UnderTheHood/blob/master/Teams/rishi_dhruv_abir_vishant/README.md)


The final phase of the project required us to implement a Date Converter using MIPS Assembly Language.
It has the following two functions
1. To convert the date into a required format(eg - DD/MM/YYYY)
2. To check what was the weekday on that date

The program takes 3 inputs initially - Date, Month and Year. Then you have to choose the required format and 
then it asks you if you want to know the weekday or not. There is also a restart option at the end so that 
you can add another date.


## SIMPLE CALCULATOR
 Written by Team : [Surviving with Google](https://github.com/suvratp21/UnderTheHood/blob/master/Surviving%20with%20Google/README.md)


The final phase of the project required us to implement a <i>Simple Calculator</i> in MIPS Assembly Language.
It has following functionalities on integers.
1. Addition (+)
2. Subtraction (-)
3. Multiplication (*)
4. Division (/)
5. Modulus (%)

The calculator takes a single integer at a time followed by an operator. Then it takes a second integer and prints the current answer.
The calculator will perform the operations till '=' operator is encountered or an error occurs.

We have developed a Scientific calculator which can do the following operations on the two numbers a and b given in the input:
1) a^b modulo 4999
2) log<sub>b</sub> a
3) gcd of a,b
4) lcm of a,b
5) a<sup>(1/b)</sup>

The interface shows all the instructions for the users to operate the Scientific Calculator. Users can refer to the interface and continue using the calculator.
